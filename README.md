# E-Commerce-Customer
It is POC project 
You just got some contract work with an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.
The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. 

We'll work with the Ecommerce Customers csv file from the company. It has Customer info, suchas Email, Address, and their color Avatar. Then it also has numerical value columns:
Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.
Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes
Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes
Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member.

Exploratory Data Analysis
Created many Plot to understand the Data and increase the Knowldege of relationship between the Data.
We only using the Numerical Data for analysis as Start(if you want to help using the categorial or any other data please HELP)

Then split the data into train and test data. And then create a model that can be fit on to the Data to find the BEST fit plane for the Data using Linear Regression Techinque.

Then apply this model on to the test data and evaluate our model performance by calculating the residual sum of squares and the explained variance score (R^2).

if it is good fit then we can conculde the result we want to predict.
